I had a lot of difficulties go through this assignment, as a foreigner who native language isn't English, learning how to write codes added another layer to my workflow, but the results are rewarding.  I did a lot of test on Github before I started working on the real one, I also learned that in coding, I have to write my own extension, It took me a while to figure out how to create a .txt file. But once I understood it, it's hard to miss it again.
