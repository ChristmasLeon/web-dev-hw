# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Liuyan Liu
The reason I choose to take this class is because as a filmmaker, I think it is essential to understand the basics of web design and the artistic element within coding.

But what exactly is the internet? I am amazed by:

- Although nowadays we connect to internet wirelessly, but the internet cable is connected under deep ocean.
- If the cable has any problems under the ocean, it will requires human activities to repair which for me is a very intense work.
- 25 years ago if someone unplugs Tim Berners-Lee's computer, it would shutdown the entire internet.
